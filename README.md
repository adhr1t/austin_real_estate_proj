# Austin Real Estate: Project Overview
I scraped and accumulated housing and demographic data of homes in the suburbs of Austin, Texas. I then use various analysis and mapping methods to show where good locations would be to potentially invest in homes to put up for rent. I have an interest in these sorts of real estate opportunities, and being able to congregate all this relevant data into one interactive location makes me more confident in my decision making.
